<p> This web page is developed as a answer for Dadepardazesaba company task. In this Web page You can search between mobiles of our warehouse.(7 samples)</p>
<p> for now you can add new item by ckicking on "Insert" on above navbar.</p>
<p> also search is available through "Search" ckick and query sets can be based on the nationality and brand name. besides, you can check if natinality and country (that contains factory) are equal.</p>

<p>It seems for next step we should add user registeration with different accebilitis, some users can add or mofify database and others just can search</p>
